            If you’re heading into the college search with a major already in mind—great! That kind of
            focus can help you streamline your choices and find programs that match your goals. But
            knowing what you want to study is just the beginning.
            Here are some key tips to help you apply to college with a declared major:
            1. Research Programs in Depth
            Not all majors are created equal at every college. Some schools have nationally ranked
            programs, cutting-edge research opportunities, or strong connections to industries and
            internships. Dig into the specifics.
            2. Check for Admission Requirements
            Some majors—especially in areas like engineering, nursing, business, or performing arts—
            may have separate or more competitive admissions processes. These might include higher
            GPA thresholds, prerequisite courses, portfolios, or auditions.
            3. Explore Related Opportunities Early
            If you know your major, you can already begin thinking about how to enrich that path.
            Xavier offers study abroad, internships opportunities, clubs, and can even help you make a
            plan for future grad school.
            4. Communicate Your Passion in Your Application
            Knowing your major gives you a strong foundation for your application essays. Use your
            essay to share:
            • Why you chose your major
            • What experiences led you there
            • What you hope to do with your degree
            Being sure of your major is a great advantage—but stay curious and adaptable. College
            may deepen your passion or shift your path slightly, and that’s okay. The more proactive
            and thoughtful you are now, the more you’ll get out of your academic journey later.

            Thinking About a Major, But Still Exploring? Here’s How to Apply to College with
            Confidence
            Having a major in mind, even if you're still exploring, is a smart move. It means you can
            begin looking at colleges with a purpose, while still leaving room to grow and discover new
            interests.
            You’ve shown interest in MAJOR, and that’s a great place to start.

            Here are some additional tips to help you navigate the application process when you’ve
            mostly decided, but are still open to exploring:
            1. Start with What Interests You
            You’ve identified an area you’re curious or passionate about. That’s valuable! As you
            research colleges, look for programs that support your current interest and give you
            flexibility to pivot or branch out.
            2. Explore Schools, Like Xavier, That Support Exploratory Students
            It’s completely normal not to know what you want to major in when applying. Xavier offers
            an Exploratory major, for just that reason! Being undecided can actually be a strength—it
            shows you’re open to discovery and growth.
            3. Talk to People Who’ve Been There
            Reach out to current college students or alumni in your potential major. Ask how they
            chose their path and whether they changed their minds along the way. You might be
            surprised by how many people shift focus after their first year—and how valuable that
            flexibility was.
            4. Use Your Application to Show Curiosity and Openness
            You don’t have to pretend to be 100% certain in your essays. In fact, colleges appreciate
            students who are intellectually curious and reflective.
            Being interested in a major—without locking yourself in—is a great position to be in. You’ve
            got direction, but also the flexibility to discover even more about yourself in college. The
            key is to apply to schools that support both your current interests and your future
            exploration.

            Here are some additional tips as you consider your options:
            1. Start with Your Interests and Strengths
            Think about the subjects you enjoy and excel in. Your natural interests and talents can be
            good indicators of where you might thrive academically and professionally.
            Ask yourself:
            • What subjects do I look forward to?
            • What kinds of tasks make me lose track of time?
            • Have teachers or mentors praised me for certain skills?
            2. Explore Career Goals and Job Market Trends
            While you don’t need to have your entire future mapped out, it helps to consider where
            different majors might lead. Some fields—like nursing, computer science, or engineering—
            have more defined career paths, while others—like philosophy or history—offer broader
            options in fields like law, education, or business.
            Things to research:
            • What kinds of jobs do graduates in this major typically get?
            • What is the job outlook and salary range in that field?
            • Does the major require advanced degrees to be competitive?
            3. Understand the Flexibility of Your Choice
            Many students change their major at least once during college. Xavier makes it easy to
            switch between majors and encourages exploration!
            4. Don’t Panic if You’re Undecided
            It’s completely normal not to know what you want to major in when applying. Xavier offers
            an Exploratory major, for just that reason! Being undecided can actually be a strength—it
            shows you’re open to discovery and growth.
            Choosing a major is a big decision, but it’s not irreversible. Stay curious, ask questions,
            and give yourself permission to explore. College is not just about preparing for a job—it’s
            also about discovering who you are and what kind of life you want to build.
