  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If you're unsure about what to major in, that's okay! More than a third of the students in a typical first-year class at Xavier haven't chosen a major yet. And many people switch during their first or second year. Our Exploratory Program allows students to work with professors, academic advisors, and mentors to discover what majors or careers are right for them. To see a full list of Xavier's offered majors and minors visit <a href="https://www.xavier.edu/academics">xavier.edu/academics</a>.</p>
